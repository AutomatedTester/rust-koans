Rust Koans
==========

The Rust Koans walks you along the path of enlightenment in order to learn Rust. The goal is to learn the Rust language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in Rust.o
